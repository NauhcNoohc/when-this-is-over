# When this is over

In quarantine and keep thinking of ideas and things to do but cant?

whenthisisover.io is a project that keeps track of all those little things and emails you when the quarantine is over to remind you.

Add restaurants, todo items, places to visit or even little notes to keep your spirits high and get you through the crisis with the knowledge that this will be over and life will go on.
